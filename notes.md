# Notes

Include any additional notes below including assumptions made, 
design decisions that you made, additional libraries added or anything that you did that was beyond the asks.

Assumption:
1. Each rental entry for each book so multiple entry for same cardholder with different book (Return scenario)

Improvement can be made to data model instead of taging entire cardholder information and Book information in rental just the primary keys reference would have made in rental entity
